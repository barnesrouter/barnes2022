Helping our commercial and residential customers enhance their landscape is a vital part of Barnes services.</p>\n\n<p>Barnes offers comprehensive estimates for any landscape maintenance work. Barnes personnel can estimate your yard work after an on-site visit with you, or on our own when you are not available. Whenever possible, it is a good idea to walk the property with your Barnes professional to discuss the work to be done in detail.</p>\n\n<p>Seasonal clean-ups are designed to take care of planting beds (see BedCare) and overall yard maintenance, with attention to the appropriate seasonal practices. For example, in the spring, pruning, herbicide and mulching are important. In the fall, leaf removal and fertilization are appropriate.</p>\n                \n              \n              <div className=\"in-image section-sm\">\n                <Img \n                  fluid={data.landscapeMaintenance2.childImageSharp.fluid}\n                  alt=\"Barnes Professional Design Process\" \n                  className=\"in-image-img\"\n                />\n                <h3 className=\"in-image-text no-margin\">Landscape Maintenance Services</h3>\n                <div className=\"video-contain__gradient\" />\n              </div>\n\n<h4>Bedcare</h4>\n<p>Barnes Nursery Inc. provides an expert bed maintenance service that can include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Selective pruning — controls the size and shape and improves plant health</li>\n  <li>Defining bed lines — enhances overall appearance by proper edge cutting</li>\n  <li>Weeding and weed control — removes existing weeds and adds herbicide (weed preventer)</li>\n  <li>Fertilizing — provides nutrients to support healthy plant growth</li>\n  <li>Mulching — provides a finished, professional appearance to the landscape.
